Scoreoid HTML5 demo app for GameFromScratch.com

This is a YUI3 HTML5 application demonstrating the Scoreoid Cloud gaming SDK.  You can use this application as the basis for your own game management code.  It is based on the MVC model without the M(odel).

In order to run this application it needs to be run on a server.  If you are running it locally I have provided a Node based server for you.  If you have Node installed, simply run:

node server.js

You can then access the application in your browser at

http://localhost:3000


This application uses my own application keys, be sure to change them to yours.  The keys are set into the global Y namespace in index.html.  Since I am making my keys public and this application has the ability to change values, I take no responsibility for content you might encounter!  Please be mature about it.
